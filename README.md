# DEATH ROW TACO

Death Row Taco is a unique, fictional two-way marketplace app for buying and selling in-house made Tacos by everyday legends from across Perth, W.A.

## R7 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app

Many residents across Perth, W.A share a passion for Taco's but shop front space prices are rising and available locations within walking distance are almost null. Residents across Perth who are considering starting their own food truck business or a store front can now have an opportunity to join an online community of like-minded individuals who are either buying or selling home made Tacos.

- Requires low initial investment for individuals who are interested in a side hussle or who may be considering starting their own food van business.
- By using Death Row Taco's platform you can save hundreds and thousands on business set-up costs and put all that extra money towards marketing and growing your online business.
